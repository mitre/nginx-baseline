Status: Accepted

All directives specified in this STIG must be specifically set (i.e. the
server is not allowed to revert to programmed defaults for these directives).
Included files should be reviewed if they are used. Procedures for reviewing
included files are included in the overview document. The use of .htaccess
files are not authorized for use according to the STIG. However, if they are
used, there are procedures for reviewing them in the overview document. The
Web Policy STIG should be used in addition to the Apache Site and Server STIGs
in order to do a comprehensive web server review.

  desc "By their very nature, CGI type files permit the anonymous web user to
  interact with data and perhaps store data on the web server. In many cases,
  CGI scripts exercise system-level control over the serverâ€™s resources. These
  files make appealing targets for the malicious user. If these files can be
  modified or exploited, the web server can be compromised. These files must
  be monitored by a security tool that reports unauthorized changes to these

  provided by asking to see the template file or configuration file of the
  software being used to accomplish this security task. Example file
