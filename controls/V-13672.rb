Benchmark: APACHE SERVER 2.2 for Unix
Status: Accepted

All directives specified in this STIG must be specifically set (i.e. the
server is not allowed to revert to programmed defaults for these directives).
Included files should be reviewed if they are used. Procedures for reviewing
included files are included in the overview document. The use of .htaccess
files are not authorized for use according to the STIG. However, if they are
used, there are procedures for reviewing them in the overview document. The
Web Policy STIG should be used in addition to the Apache Site and Server STIGs
in order to do a comprehensive web server review.

  vulnerable to accepting certificates that have expired or have been revoked.
  This would allow unauthorized individuals access to the web server.  This also

  administrator, or developers as necessary to determine if the web server is
  configured to utilize an approved DoD certificate validation process.

  The web administrator should be questioned to determine if a validation
  process is being utilized on the web server.

  To validate this, the reviewer can ask the web administrator to describe the
  validation process being used. They should be able to identify either the use
  of certificate revocation lists (CRLs) or Online Certificate Status Protocol
  (OCSP).

  If the production web server is accessible, the SA or the web administrator
  should be able to demonstrate the validation of good certificates and the
  rejection of bad certificates.

  If CRLs are being used, the SA should be able to identify how often the CRL is
  updated and the location from which the CRL is downloaded.

  If the web administrator cannot identify the type of validation process being
  used, this is a finding."
