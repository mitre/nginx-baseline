Benchmark: APACHE SERVER 2.2 for Unix
Status: Accepted

All directives specified in this STIG must be specifically set (i.e. the
server is not allowed to revert to programmed defaults for these directives).
Included files should be reviewed if they are used. Procedures for reviewing
included files are included in the overview document. The use of .htaccess
files are not authorized for use according to the STIG. However, if they are
used, there are procedures for reviewing them in the overview document. The
Web Policy STIG should be used in addition to the Apache Site and Server STIGs
in order to do a comprehensive web server review.

  desc "Modules are the source of nginx httpd servers core and dynamic
  capabilities. Thus not every module available is needed for operation. Most
  installations only need a small subset of the modules available. By
  minimizing the enabled modules to only those that are required, we reduce
  the number of doors and have therefore reduced the attack surface of the web
  site. Likewise having fewer modules means less software that could have
  vulnerabilities."
