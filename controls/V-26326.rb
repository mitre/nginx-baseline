Benchmark: APACHE SERVER 2.2 for Unix
Status: Accepted

All directives specified in this STIG must be specifically set (i.e. the
server is not allowed to revert to programmed defaults for these directives).
Included files should be reviewed if they are used. Procedures for reviewing
included files are included in the overview document. The use of .htaccess
files are not authorized for use according to the STIG. However, if they are
used, there are procedures for reviewing them in the overview document. The
Web Policy STIG should be used in addition to the Apache Site and Server STIGs
in order to do a comprehensive web server review.

  title "The web server must be configured to listen on a specific IP address
  and port."

  desc "The nginx listen directive specifies the IP addresses and port numbers
  the nginx web server will listen for requests. Rather than be unrestricted
  to listen on all IP addresses available to the system, the specific IP
  address or addresses intended must be explicitly specified. Specifically a
  Listen directive with no IP address specified, or with an IP address of
  zeroâ€™s should not be used. Having multiple interfaces on web servers is
  fairly common, and without explicit Listen directives, the web server is
  likely to be listening on an inappropriate IP address / interface that were
  not intended for the web server. Single homed system with a single IP
  addressed are also required to have an explicit IP address in the Listen
  directive, in case additional interfaces are added to the system at a later
  date."
